## Motivation

Transportation is an essential part of daily life, and finding efficient ways to travel can have significant impacts on both time and money. With Martı scooters becoming a popular mode of transportation in urban areas, this project aims to analyze whether using scooters instead of walking is a cost-efficient and time-saving option. The goal is to quantify the time saved by using scooters and evaluate the associated financial costs.
